It is responsible for reading data from Cardano blockchain and broadcasting events.\nIt also monitors and records the current point in the database.\nEvents are published as Spring events, so developers can write their own Spring event listeners to listen these events and process them accordingly.","stores#Stores":"Each store is a specialized module designed for a specific data type or use case.A store has the ability to:\nListen to events published by the core module.\nProcess data.\nStore data in a persistent store.\nPublish derived events. (Optional)\nProvide REST endpoints to retrieve data (optional).\nEach of the above functionalities can be overridden by developers through the use of Spring Beans.Note: To simplify the rollback process, stores do not handle any data aggregation.","aggregates#Aggregates":"Aggregates are modules that handle different kind of data aggregation. They are responsible for aggregating data from different stores and persisting them in a persistent store.\nCurrently, the only available aggregate is \"Account\", which provides account balance related data. It depends on the \"utxo\" store and the event published by utxo store.\nBut status of this module is still experimental.","persistence#Persistence":"By default, Yaci Store uses a relational database to store data. The database schema is generated automatically by Flyway.\nSupported databases include: PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2An application can also use a custom persistence store by implementing a store's Storage api.","tx-submission#Tx Submission":"The \"submit\" module provides the ability to submit transactions to nodes directly, either through n2c or the submit API.","stores---components#Stores - Components":"A store is composed of the following components:1. Processor: A processor is responsible for processing data. It listens to events published by the core module and processes the data contained in the event. A processor can also publish derived events.\nFor example: UtxoProcessor in the utxo store listens to TransactionEvent and processes the UTxOs contained in the transaction. It also publishes AddressUtxo derived event for each UTxO.Developer can write their own processor by listening to events published by the core module.2. Storage: A storage defines the interface for storing data. The implementation of a storage api is responsible for storing data in a persistent store.\nBy default, Yaci Store uses a relational database to store data and each store provides a default implementation of corresponding storage api using JPA.This can be overridden by developers by implementing the storage api in consuming applications.3. Controller: A controller provides REST endpoints to retrieve store's data. It uses the storage api to retrieve data from the persistent store.\nOut of the box, Yaci Store provides some common REST endpoints for all stores. But, developers can implement their own REST endpoints.","handling-rollbacks#Handling Rollbacks":"Yaci Store follows a simply strategy to handle rollbacks. As store modules don't handle any data aggregation, the rollback handling becomes simple.\nEach table in a store maintains a slot column. When a processor received a RollbackEvent event, it deletes all the records with a slot greater than\nthe rollback slot mentioned in the event.But as aggregates handle data aggregation, the rollback handling becomes a bit complex. But with a simple strategy, we can handle rollbacks in aggregates as well.\nFor example, the Account module aggregates account balance. But instead of storing the account balance for an address in one record, balance snapshot is stored for a slot.\nAs we don't update existing records during aggregation, rollback can be handled by simply deleting all the records with a slot greater than the rollback slot mentioned in the event.If you are using Yaci Store as a library in your application with your own domain model and tables, you can follow the similar strategy to handle rollbacks.","idempotency#Idempotency":"Though Yaci Store ensures that the same event is not published more than once, it is possible that the same event is published more than once in some scenarios. All out-of-box\nmodules are idepotent. But if you are writing your own stores, you should make sure that your modules are idempotent.","yaci-store---sequential-block-processing#Yaci Store - Sequential Block Processing":"","yaci-store---parallel-block-processing#Yaci Store - Parallel Block Processing":""}},"/docker":{"title":"Run with Docker Compose","data":{"":"There are three out-of-the-box applications available in the Yaci Store repository:\nYaci Store Utxo Indexer : Includes Utxo Store, Epoch Store, and Submit component\nYaci Store All : Includes all stores\nYaci Store Aggregation : Aggregates account balances\nYou can run out-of-the-box applications with Docker Compose.

Core Modules":"Core modules serve a critical purpose. They read data directly from Cardano blockchain and then publish various domain-specific events.\nSince these events are essentially Spring events, developers have the freedom to write their own Spring event listeners.\nThis allows them to tap into these events and process them accordingly. In addition to this, the core module monitors and records\nthe current point in the database.Major core modules include:\ncore\ncommon\nevents\nEvents published by core modules:\nBlockEvent\nBlockHeaderEvent\nByronEbBlockEvent\nByronMainBlockEvent\nRollbackEvent\nTransactionEvent\nMintBurnEvent\nScriptEvent\nCertificateEvent\nGenesisBlockEvent\nAuxDataEvent\nGovernanceEvent\nDerived Events: Events published by stores\nAddressUtxoEvent\nTxAssetEvent\nTxMetadataEvent\nDatumEvent\nTxScriptEvent","2-stores#2. Stores":"A \"store\" in Yaci Store is a specialized module designed for a specific data type or use case. Each store has a set of capabilities:\nEvent Listening: Listen to events published by the core module.\nData Processing: Processes event data.\nData Persistence: Saves processed data to a dedicated persistence store.\nREST Endpoints: Optionally provides REST endpoints for data retrieval.\nAvailable Store Implementations:\nutxo: Focuses on UTxOs, extracting them from transaction data.\nblock: Dedicated to handling and storing block data.\ntransaction: Takes care of transaction data.\nassets: Manages data related to asset minting and burning.\nmetadata: Retrieves and processes metadata events.\nscript: Deals with the ScriptEvent, get datums and redeemers.\nstaking: Handles from stake address registration to pool registration and more.\nmir: All about Mir data.\nepoch: Stores protocol params proposals and epoch protocol params. It also fetches protocol parameters from nodes via n2c.\ngovernance: Manages governance on-chain data.\nAdditional Modules:\nsubmit: Enables transaction submissions to nodes, either through n2c or the submit API.\nEach of the mentioned stores is available as a Spring Boot starter. This means that integrating a specific store into your\napplication is as straightforward as adding its Spring Boot starter as a dependency.","3-aggregates#3. Aggregates":"Aggregates are modules that handle different kind of data aggregation. They are responsible for aggregating data from different stores and persisting them in a persistent store.\nCurrently, the only available aggregate is \"Account\" , which provides account balance related data.

However, if you want to set up multiple read-only yaci-store instances alongside one write instance,\nyou can disable auto-sync in the read-only instances. This way, the read-only instances will only read from the database and not write to it.\nstore.sync-auto-start=false","store-specific-application#Store specific application":"Yaci Store bundles all stores by default, and you can enable or disable stores by setting a store-specific enable flag in the application.properties file.\nThis makes it possible to have multiple instances of yaci-store with different stores enabled. These individual instances can write to their own separate databases with the default configuration.However, if you want to have multiple store-specific yaci-store applications writing to the same database, each application needs to maintain its own cursor in the cursor_ table.This is achievable by assigning a unique event publisher ID to each yaci-store application.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up a lightweight Cardano indexer that tracks transactions and UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) for a specific address.What is Yaci Store?\nYaci Store is a Cardano blockchain indexer that reads data from the blockchain and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. Think of it as a specialized tool that helps you extract and organize blockchain data for your applications.What will you build?\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll have a running Yaci Store instance that:\nSynchronizes with the Cardano blockchain\nTracks UTXOs only for one specific address (ignoring everything else)\nStores the data in an easily queryable database\nOptionally sends you Discord notifications when the address balance changes\nWhy is this useful?\nInstead of indexing the entire Cardano blockchain (which requires significant storage and processing power), you can focus on just the data you need. This is perfect for:\nMonitoring a treasury wallet\nTracking payments to a specific address\nBuilding lightweight applications that only care about one address\nDevelopment and testing with minimal resource requirements\nWhat you'll learn:\nHow to set up Yaci Store using Docker\nHow to configure and enable plugins\nHow to write custom filtering logic\nHow to query blockchain data from the database\nLet's get started!","prerequisites#Prerequisites":"Before we begin, make sure you have:\nDocker and Docker Compose installed on your system\nInstall Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows\nInstall Docker Engine for Linux\nBasic familiarity with Cardano addresses\nEstimated time: 20-30 minutes\nThis tutorial uses the Cardano preprod testnet, which is perfect for learning without dealing with real ADA or requiring extensive storage.","step-1-download-yaci-store#Step 1: Download Yaci Store":"First, let's get the Yaci Store Docker distribution.\nDownload the latest releaseVisit the Yaci Store releases page and download the Docker distribution archive (look for yaci-store-docker-<version>.zip).For example: yaci-store-docker-2.0.0-beta5.zip\nExtract the archive\n# For .tar.gz files\nunzip yaci-store-docker-<version>.zip\ncd yaci-store-docker-<version>\nExplore the directory structureYou should see the following files and folders:\nyaci-store/\n├── yaci-store.sh          # Main script to start/stop Yaci Store\n├── admin-cli.sh           # Admin operations\n├── monitoring.sh          # Optional monitoring stack\n├── psql.sh                # Quick database access\n├── LICENSE                # License\n├── compose/              # Docker compose files\n│   ├── .env             # Docker image versions\n│   ├── admin-cli-compose.yml\n│   ├── monitoring.yml\n│   ├── postgres-compose.yml\n│   ├── postgres-compose-minimal.yml\n│   ├── yaci-store.yml\n│   └── yaci-store-monolith.yml\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   ├── env              # Environment variables\n│   ├── application.properties\n│   ├── application-ledger-state.properties\n│   └── application-plugins.yml\n└── plugins/      # Where we'll put our custom plugins\n    ├── ext-jars\n    └── scripts\nThe yaci-store.sh script is your main interface.
