##  üè¨ Stores

A ‚Äústore‚Äù in Yaci Store is a specialized module designed for a specific data type or use case. Each store has a set of capabilities:

- **Event Listening**: Listen to events published by the core module  
- **Data Processing**: Processes event data  
- **Data Persistence**: Saves processed data to a dedicated persistence store  
- **REST Endpoints**: Optionally provides REST endpoints for data retrieval

Each of the mentioned stores is available as a Spring Boot starter. This means that integrating a specific store into your application is as straightforward as adding its Spring Boot starter as a dependency.
