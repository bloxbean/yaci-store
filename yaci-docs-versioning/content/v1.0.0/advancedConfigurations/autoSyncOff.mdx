## 🔁 Auto Sync Off

In most cases, you should have **only one write instance** of Yaci Store running.

However, if you want to deploy **multiple read-only Yaci Store instances** alongside one write instance, you can disable auto-sync in the read-only instances.

This ensures the read-only instances will **only read from the database** and will **not attempt to write** to it.

### 🔧 Configuration

To disable auto-sync:

```properties
store.sync-auto-start=false
