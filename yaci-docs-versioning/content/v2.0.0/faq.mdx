# ‚ùì Yaci Store ‚Äî Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

---

## 1. What is the purpose of Yaci Store?

Yaci Store is a modular, event-driven indexing framework for the Cardano blockchain. It captures and stores on-chain data in a structured way, making it easy for developers to build services, analytics tools, and applications that require efficient access to blockchain state and transactions.

---

## 2. What is the key difference between Yaci Store and other chain indexers?

Yaci Store is **modular**, **developer-friendly**, and **plugin-based**. Unlike monolithic indexers like DB Sync or some flat-file indexers, Yaci Store allows you to selectively enable or disable indexing modules ("stores"), giving you flexibility to tailor it for your specific use case or performance needs.

---

## 3. What are the key features that Yaci Store offers?

- üîå **Plugin-based architecture** ‚Äì Easily add or remove indexing modules
- üöÄ **Fast sync** ‚Äì Designed to be highly performant with quick sync from genesis
- üß© **Event-driven model** ‚Äì Reacts to chain events in near-real-time
- üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable** ‚Äì Add your own stores or replace internal logic
- üß™ **Built-in REST APIs** ‚Äì Includes ready-to-use API endpoints via Yaci Store Server

---

## 4. What are the key benefits offered by Yaci Store?

- üß± **Fine-grained modularity**: Use only what you need
- üìä **Rich data availability**: Access on-chain data with ready-to-use REST endpoints
- üõ°Ô∏è **Open source and extensible**: Adapt it to new Cardano protocol features
- üèóÔ∏è **Developer-centric**: Easier to maintain and integrate compared to legacy indexers
- üíº **Supports multiple stores in parallel**: Ideal for specialized services

---

## 5. How long does it take to sync the database from scratch?

Syncing speed depends on your hardware and enabled stores. On a modern machine, syncing **mainnet with all core stores** (UTXO, transactions, blocks, stake, etc.) can take **a few hours**, which is significantly faster than DB Sync.

---

## 6. When should I choose to use Yaci Store over other chain indexers?

You should consider Yaci Store if:
- ‚úÖ You need **high performance and fast sync**.
- ‚úÖ You want to build **custom dApps or services** with tailored data needs.
- ‚úÖ You prefer **clean APIs and modular control** over indexed content.
- ‚úÖ You want a **lightweight indexer** for a single feature (e.g. UTXOs only).

For full-node-style historical analytics or deeply integrated ledger state, legacy tools like DB Sync may still be required. Yaci Store is ideal for modern, efficient, and composable backends.

- üöÄ **High sync performance** with optional data pruning
- üõ†Ô∏è **Built-in REST APIs with Swagger UI**‚Äîno GraphQL or extra layers required
- ü™∂ **Lighter footprint** compared to DB Sync and some Haskell-based solutions

---

### 3. What features does Yaci Store offer?

- üì¶ **Pluggable Stores**: Enable/disable data stores like transactions, assets, blocks, rewards, and governance
- üß≠ **Governance & Reward Indexing**: Access to proposal statuses, DRep tracking, delegation, and reward events
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Pruning Support**: Reduce disk usage by trimming old UTxO and transaction data
- üêò **PostgreSQL-native**: All indexed data is stored in a normalized SQL schema
- üß™ **RESTful API**: Swagger auto-documented endpoints, easy to integrate
- üîÑ **Standalone or Docker**: Supports multiple deployment models

---

### 4. What benefits does Yaci Store bring?

- ‚ö° **Fast Full-Chain Syncing** (~24h under tested conditions)
- üß∞ **Customizable Store Composition** for lighter deployments
- üíæ **Disk Efficiency with Pruning Options**
- üî¨ **Detailed Governance & Ledger State Tracking**
- üîç **Transparent and queryable via API without extra infrastructure**
- üë∑ **Suited for both production and experimental usage**

---

### 5. How long does it take to sync the database from scratch?

Here are results from our most recent benchmarks:

#### üß™ Test Environment

- VM: 64 GB RAM, 32 cores
- Cardano Node: IOG public relay (remote)
- Storage: Docker Compose, PostgreSQL with `shm_size=2g`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Yaci Store does *not* require 64 GB RAM. A VM with **8‚Äì10 GB RAM** and **6‚Äì8 cores** is typically sufficient.

#### üîç Sync Results

| Configuration                            | Sync Time | Disk Usage |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| All on-chain data (ledger state off)    | ~24h      | 689 GB     |
| With transaction witness enabled         | ~24h      | ~790 GB    |
| With UTXO pruning enabled                | ~24h      | 338 GB     |

> Transaction pruning was disabled during these tests but is supported.  
> Additional benchmarks (including with ledger state enabled) are planned.

### 6. When should I choose Yaci Store over other indexers?

Yaci Store is the ideal choice when you need:

- A fast alternative to DB Sync with **lower resource requirements**
- Full access to **on-chain governance**, **DReps**, **proposal history**, and **staking data**
- Fine-grained **modularity and control** over what data to index
- A **PostgreSQL-backed indexer** with a developer-friendly API layer

## ‚öñÔ∏è How does Yaci Store compare to other indexers?

| **Solution**        | **Language** | **Key Characteristics** |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Kupo**           | Rust     | Kupo focuses exclusively on UTxO indexing and offers a blazing-fast HTTP API to retrieve UTxOs by address, stake address, or policy ID. It is lightweight but lacks broader chain state support (e.g. governance, rewards). |
| **Yaci Store**      | Java         | Full ledger state indexer with REST APIs, governance/rewards support, pruning, and multiple storage backends. |
| **Oura**            | Rust         | Event-based filter pipeline; no built-in storage ‚Äî requires external sinks like Kafka or Elastic. |
| **Adder**           | Go           | Event emitter with filters; no built-in persistence ‚Äî needs backend integration. |
| **Scrolls**         | Rust         | In-memory Redis-based aggregator; best for real-time metrics, not full-chain history. |
| **Carp**            | Rust         | Plugin-based indexer built on Oura; stores in PostgreSQL using custom or prebuilt tasks. |
| **Cardano DB-Sync** | Haskell      | Most complete indexer; heavy on resources and sync time; full PostgreSQL schema. |

## 7. When should I choose Yaci Store over other chain indexers?

Choose **Yaci Store** if you:

- Need rich governance and rewards data with ledger-state accuracy.
- Want a pluggable, standalone indexer with no external dependencies.
- Prefer REST APIs over writing custom sinks.
- Need fine-grained pruning for space efficiency.
- Are building systems that rely on stake snapshots, constitutional state, or DRep data.

Use alternatives like **Oura** or **Carp** if you're designing event-based pipelines, need quick filters, or already use Kafka/Redis for real-time streaming.
