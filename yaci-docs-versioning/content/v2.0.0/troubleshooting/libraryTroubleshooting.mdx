## 📦 Yaci Store as a Library

### 1. ❌ Missing Events or Data

**Symptoms**: Your application does not receive events, or data is missing.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you subscribed to the correct event types from the event bus.

### 2. 💤 No Chain Sync Happening

**Symptoms**: Your embedded Yaci Store is not syncing with the chain.

**Solutions**:
- Confirm that chain connection configuration is correct (e.g., node socket or host/port).
- If using **Ogmios** or **Node-to-Client**, verify that the node is accessible.
- Ensure the following is set in `application.properties`:

<pre><code class="language-properties">
store.sync-auto-start=true
</code></pre>

- Or manually start syncing from your application code.

### 3. 🗃️ Custom Store Not Writing to DB

**Symptoms**: Your store processes events but nothing is saved to the database.

**Solutions**:
- Double check your repository/service layer implementation.
- Make sure transactional annotations like `@Transactional` are used properly.
- Ensure the correct database dialect and driver are configured in `application.properties`.
