- **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-built dashboards for performance monitoring and system health
- **Extended Network Coverage**: Improved epoch support across all Cardano networks
- **Advanced Governance Tracking**: Better governance state data management

### 🔧 Improvements
- **Network Epoch Support Extended**:
  - **Mainnet**: Now supports up to epoch **569** (vs unspecified in beta1)
  - **Preprod**: Validated up to epoch **227**
  - **Preview**: Tested up to epoch **989**
- **Performance Optimizations**: Better reward calculation efficiency during epoch transitions
- **Enhanced Admin CLI**: Improved tools for database management and optional indexing
- **Stability Improvements**: Resolved critical governance calculation issues from beta1

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed governance proposal status calculation discrepancies
- Resolved DRep distribution mismatches in specific epoch ranges
- Improved ledger state accuracy for treasury and reserves calculations
- Enhanced synchronization timing for governance data

### 📊 Known Limitations
- Mainnet reward calculations still require 20-40 minutes during epoch transitions
- Some minor governance state data mismatches may occur in edge cases
- Performance considerations remain for full mainnet deployments

## 🎯 v2.0.0-beta1 (Initial Beta)

**Release Date:** January 2024  
**Status:** Legacy

### 🌟 Breakthrough Features
- **First Beta Release**: Initial implementation of independent ledger-state computation
- **Ledger State Independence**: Calculate epoch stake, rewards, and ADAPot values directly from on-chain data
- **Multi-Network Support**: Full support for Mainnet, Preprod, and Preview networks
- **Modern Architecture**: Built on Java 21 with virtual threads and Spring Boot

### 🛠️ Core Capabilities
- **Independent Calculations**: No reliance on external ledger state providers
- **Comprehensive Data Access**: Blocks, transactions, UTXOs, native assets, governance data
- **Flexible Deployment**: Docker, ZIP distributions, and native GraalVM binaries
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom data processing

### ⚠️ Known Issues (Resolved in beta3)
- **Mainnet Epoch 546**: Treasury and reserves calculation mismatches
  - Treasury: 62,510 ADA difference with DB Sync
  - Reserves: 35,580,032 ADA difference with DB Sync
- **Governance Actions**: Some proposal status discrepancies with official DB Sync
- **Limited Monitoring**: Basic logging without comprehensive metrics
- **Performance**: Suboptimal reward calculation during epoch transitions

### 📈 Performance Baseline
- **Sync Time**: 24-48 hours for full mainnet synchronization
- **Resource Usage**: 8-16 GB RAM recommended for production workloads
- **Database Growth**: ~20 GB/month with all stores enabled
