## 1. What is the purpose of Yaci Store?

Yaci Store is a modular and extensible chain indexer for the Cardano blockchain. It extracts and indexes comprehensive on-chain data into a PostgreSQL database and exposes high-performance RESTful APIs. Designed for developers, it supports fast queries, easy customization, and seamless integration with applications that need insight into transaction flows, accounts, rewards, and governance.

---

## 2. What makes Yaci Store different from other indexers?

Yaci Store stands out by combining **performance, modularity, and completeness**:

- ✅ **First full-featured indexer after DB Sync** that tracks **rewards**, **epoch stake**, and **governance state**
- 🧩 **Modular plugin architecture**: Activate only the stores you need
- 🚀 **High sync performance** with optional data pruning
- 🛠️ **Built-in REST APIs with Swagger UI**—no GraphQL or extra layers required
- 🪶 **Lighter footprint** compared to DB Sync and some Haskell-based solutions

---

## 3. What features does Yaci Store offer?

- 📦 **Pluggable Stores**: Enable/disable data stores like transactions, assets, blocks, rewards, and governance
- 🧭 **Governance & Reward Indexing**: Access to proposal statuses, DRep tracking, delegation, and reward events
- ⚙️ **Pruning Support**: Reduce disk usage by trimming old UTxO and transaction data
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL-native**: All indexed data is stored in a normalized SQL schema
- 🧪 **RESTful API**: Swagger auto-documented endpoints, easy to integrate
- 🔄 **Standalone or Docker**: Supports multiple deployment models

---

## 4. What benefits does Yaci Store bring?

- ⚡ **Fast Full-Chain Syncing** (~24h under tested conditions)
- 🧰 **Customizable Store Composition** for lighter deployments
- 💾 **Disk Efficiency with Pruning Options**
- 🔬 **Detailed Governance & Ledger State Tracking**
- 🔍 **Transparent and queryable via API without extra infrastructure**
- 👷 **Suited for both production and experimental usage**

---

## 5. How long does it take to sync the database from scratch?

Here are results from our most recent benchmarks:

### 🧪 Test Environment

- VM: 64 GB RAM, 32 cores
- Cardano Node: IOG public relay (remote)
- Storage: Docker Compose, PostgreSQL with `shm_size=2g`

> ⚠️ **Note**: Yaci Store does *not* require 64 GB RAM. A VM with **8–10 GB RAM** and **6–8 cores** is typically sufficient.

### 🔍 Sync Results

| Configuration                            | Sync Time | Disk Usage |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| All on-chain data (ledger state off)    | ~24h      | 689 GB     |
| With transaction witness enabled         | ~24h      | ~790 GB    |
| With UTXO pruning enabled                | ~24h      | 338 GB     |

> Transaction pruning was disabled during these tests but is supported.  
> Additional benchmarks (including with ledger state enabled) are planned.

## 6. When should I choose Yaci Store over other indexers?

Yaci Store is the ideal choice when you need:

- A fast alternative to DB Sync with **lower resource requirements**
- Full access to **on-chain governance**, **DReps**, **proposal history**, and **staking data**
- Fine-grained **modularity and control** over what data to index
- A **PostgreSQL-backed indexer** with a developer-friendly API layer
- An easy way to **prune** unnecessary data and keep infrastructure lean
- A solution that doesn't require setting up complex GraphQL layers or Kafka pipelines

## 7. How does Yaci Store compare to other indexers?

| **Solution**        | **Language** | **Key Characteristics** |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Kupo**           | Rust     | Kupo focuses exclusively on UTxO indexing and offers a blazing-fast HTTP API to retrieve UTxOs by address, stake address, or policy ID. It is lightweight but lacks broader chain state support (e.g. governance, rewards). |
| **Yaci Store**      | Java         | Full ledger state indexer with REST APIs, governance/rewards support, pruning, and multiple storage backends. |
| **Oura**            | Rust         | Event-based filter pipeline; no built-in storage — requires external sinks like Kafka or Elastic. |
| **Adder**           | Go           | Event emitter with filters; no built-in persistence — needs backend integration. |
| **Scrolls**         | Rust         | In-memory Redis-based aggregator; best for real-time metrics, not full-chain history. |
| **Carp**            | Rust         | Plugin-based indexer built on Oura; stores in PostgreSQL using custom or prebuilt tasks. |
| **Cardano DB-Sync** | Haskell      | Most complete indexer; heavy on resources and sync time; full PostgreSQL schema. |

## 8. When should I choose alternatives over Yaci Store?

Choose **Yaci Store** if you:

- Need rich governance and rewards data with ledger-state accuracy.
- Want a pluggable, standalone indexer with no external dependencies.
- Prefer REST APIs over writing custom sinks.
- Need fine-grained pruning for space efficiency.
- Are building systems that rely on stake snapshots, constitutional state, or DRep data.

Use alternatives like **Oura** or **Carp** if you're designing event-based pipelines, need quick filters, or already use Kafka/Redis for real-time streaming.
