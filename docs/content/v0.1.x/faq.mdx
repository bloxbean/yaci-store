# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

---

## 1. What is the purpose of Yaci Store?

Yaci Store is a modular, event-driven indexing framework for the Cardano blockchain. It captures and stores on-chain data in a structured way, making it easy for developers to build services, analytics tools, and applications that require efficient access to blockchain state and transactions.

---

## 2. What is the key difference between Yaci Store and other chain indexers?

Yaci Store is **modular**, **developer-friendly**, and **plugin-based**. Unlike monolithic indexers like DB Sync or some flat-file indexers, Yaci Store allows you to selectively enable or disable indexing modules ("stores"), giving you flexibility to tailor it for your specific use case or performance needs.

## 3. What are the key features that Yaci Store offers?

- 🔌 **Plugin-based architecture** – Easily add or remove indexing modules (enhanced multi-language framework in v2.0.0+ only)
- 🚀 **Fast sync** – Designed to be highly performant with quick sync from genesis
- 🧩 **Event-driven model** – Reacts to chain events in near-real-time
- 🛠️ **Customizable** – Add your own stores or replace internal logic
- 🧪 **Built-in REST APIs** – Includes ready-to-use API endpoints via Yaci Store Server
- 🗄️ **Database completeness** – Full blockchain data indexing (ledger state available in v2.0.0+ only)

## 4. What are the key benefits offered by Yaci Store?

- 🧱 **Fine-grained modularity**: Enable or disable specific indexing modules as needed (enhanced in v2.0.0+)
- 🚀 **High performance**: Fast sync from genesis with optimized blockchain data processing  
- 🧩 **Event-driven architecture**: Real-time response to chain events for up-to-date data
- 🛠️ **Highly customizable**: Add custom stores or modify internal logic for specific requirements
- 🧪 **Ready-to-use APIs**: Built-in REST endpoints for immediate blockchain data access
- 🗄️ **Complete data indexing**: Full blockchain data capture (ledger state in v2.0.0+ only)

## 5. How long does it take to sync the database from scratch?

Yaci Store syncs Cardano on-chain data with options for UTXO Pruning and Ledger State inclusion. Sync times and storage requirements vary based on configuration:

| **Configuration** | **Sync Time** | **Storage** |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Full sync** (no UTXO Pruning, no Ledger State) | ~24h | 689 GB (790 GB with transaction_witness) |
| **Full sync + UTXO Pruning** (no Ledger State) | ~24h | 338 GB |
| **Full sync + Ledger State** (no UTXO Pruning) | ~3 days | 978 GB |
| **Full sync + Ledger State + UTXO Pruning** | ~3 days | 501 GB |

Choose the configuration that best fits your use case and infrastructure requirements.

## 6. When should I choose to use Yaci Store over other chain indexers?

You should consider Yaci Store if:
- ✅ You need **high performance and fast sync**.
- ✅ You want to build **custom dApps or services** with tailored data needs.
- ✅ You prefer **clean APIs and modular control** over indexed content.
- ✅ You want a **lightweight indexer** for a single feature (e.g. UTXOs only).

## 7. How does Yaci Store v1.x compare to other indexers?

| **Solution**        | **Language** | **Key Characteristics** |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Yaci Store v1.x** | Java         | Stable, modular indexer with REST APIs, proven in production. |
| **Yaci Store v2.x** | Java         | Includes ledger state support, plugin framework in different languages, faster sync, and improved performance. |
| **Kupo**           | Rust         | UTxO-focused indexer with fast HTTP API, lacks broader chain state support. |
| **Oura**           | Rust         | Event-based pipeline, requires external storage solutions. |
| **Carp**           | Rust         | Plugin-based indexer using PostgreSQL with custom tasks. |
| **Cardano DB-Sync** | Haskell      | Most complete but resource-heavy indexer with full PostgreSQL schema. |
