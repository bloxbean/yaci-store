# üßπ Pruning Configuration

Sometimes you may not want to store all historical data in a store. If you are using `yaci-store` as a library, you can customize it to only store specific data in your own custom storage implementation. However, if you want to delete historical data from a store database, you can use the pruning configuration.

Currently, pruning configuration is only supported for the following stores. In the future, we will add support for other stores as well:

- `utxo`
- `transaction`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è By default, pruning is **disabled** for all stores.

---

## üî∏ Utxo Pruning

To enable UTXO pruning, set the following configurations in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
store.utxo.pruning-enabled=true
store.utxo.pruning.interval=600
``` 

The above configuration will run utxo pruning every 600 seconds.

There is also another configuration, `store.utxo.pruning-safe-blocks`, which can be used to specify the number of safe blocks to keep in the store. By default, this is set to **2160 blocks**, same as the security parameter in Cardano mainnet.

## Transaction Pruning

To enable transaction pruning, you can set the following configurations in the `application.properties` file.

```properties
store.transaction.pruning-enabled=true
store.transaction.pruning.interval=86400
```
The above configuration will run transaction pruning every 86400 seconds or 1 day.
