# 🛠️ Chain Indexer Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues when running Yaci Store v1.0 as a standalone chain indexer (Spring Boot application) and their solutions.

## 🔗 Yaci Store as a Chain Indexer (Spring Boot App)

### 1. 🔄 Sync Not Starting Automatically

**Symptoms**: The application starts, but block syncing doesn't begin.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure this configuration is enabled:

<pre><code class="language-properties">
store.sync-auto-start=true
</code></pre>

- Check connectivity to the node:
  - Is `ogmios.url` or `n2c.socket-path` correctly configured?
  - Is the node fully synced and accepting connections?

---

### 2. 💾 High Disk Usage

**Symptoms**: PostgreSQL database consumes excessive disk space.

**Solutions**:
- Enable pruning in `application.properties`:

<pre><code class="language-properties">
store.utxo.pruning-enabled=true
store.transaction.pruning-enabled=true
store.utxo.pruning.interval=600
</code></pre>

- Adjust pruning intervals as necessary.
- Note: Pruning is currently supported for UTXO and transaction stores only.

### 3. 🧩 Only Some Stores Are Working

**Symptoms**: You expected governance or rewards data, but only block and transaction data appear.

**Solutions**:
- Make sure all necessary stores are enabled:

<pre><code class="language-properties">
store.reward.enabled=true
store.governance.enabled=true
</code></pre>

- Check logs for initialization errors or misconfigurations.

### 4. 🧠 Ledger State Mismatches

**Symptoms**: Rewards, DRep, or governance data differs from DB-Sync.

**Solutions**:
- Refer to the [Ledger State Mismatch Report](#📋-ledger-state-mismatch-summary) if available.
- Report discrepancies via GitHub Issues with clear details (epoch, address, tx hash, etc.).
- Ensure you're running the latest Yaci Store version with all patches applied.

### 5. 🐘 PostgreSQL Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: Queries are slow or time out.

**Solutions**:
- For containerized deployments:
  - Use `shm_size=2g` for PostgreSQL in Docker Compose.
- For native installations:
  - Tune `postgresql.conf` parameters for production workloads:
    - `shared_buffers`
    - `work_mem`
    - `max_connections`
- Ensure indexes exist on frequently queried fields (e.g. block number, tx hash, address).
