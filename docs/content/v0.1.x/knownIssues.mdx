## üîÑ Sync and Parsing Issues

### Parse Error Handling

**Issue**: Yaci Store may encounter parsing errors during blockchain sync, especially on mainnet, which can halt the indexing process.

**Affected Versions**: All v0.1.x versions

**Symptoms**:
- Sync stops unexpectedly
- Parse error messages in logs
- Incomplete blockchain data indexing

**Workaround**:
```properties
# Enable continued syncing on parse errors (v0.1.4+)
store.continue-on-parse-error=true
```

**Details**:
- When enabled, parsing errors are logged to the `ERROR` table
- Sync continues despite errors, allowing investigation while maintaining data flow
- Default is `false` to ensure data integrity
- Recommended for critical applications requiring uninterrupted syncing
