## Use out-of-the-box applications

Yaci Store comes with few applications that you can use out-of-the-box. These applications are designed to be used as-is.

- **yaci-store-all:** This application bundles all available modules/stores into a single application. If you want to index all available data, this is the application you want.
- **yaci-store-utxo-indexer:** This application contains utxo store,  protocolparams store and submit module If you want a utxo indexer with transaction submission capability, this is the application you want.
- **yaci-store-aggregation-app:** This application handles aggregation tasks like account balance calculation. This can be run as a separate application to calculate address balances.
For steps to run this application, please refer to [Aggregation App Getting Started](aggregation-app-getting-started.md) section.

The Jar files for these applications are available in the release section.


##  Run Yaci Store All or Yaci Store Utxo Indexer

## Configuration

Download the application.properties file from the release section and place it in a folder named "config" in the same directory as the jar file.
The application will automatically pick up the configuration file.

Update configuration file with your own values. Some of the key properties are mentioned below.

### Mandatory Configuration

#### Network Configuration

```
store.cardano.host=preprod-node.world.dev.cardano.org
store.cardano.port=30000
store.cardano.protocol-magic=1
```

#### Database Configuration

Uncomment and edit the following properties to configure the database connection.

```
spring.datasource.url=
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=
```

Additional configurations for database connection pool and batch insert.

```shell
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=50
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=100
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_inserts=true
```

#### Parallel Processing Configuration

The following properties are used to configure parallel processing. You can leave them as-is or change them based on
your machine configuration.

**Note:** If you are using parallel processing, you also need to configure the database connection pool size accordingly.

```
store.executor.enable-parallel-processing=true

store.executor.blocks-batch-size=200
store.executor.blocks-partition-size=10

store.executor.use-virtual-thread-for-batch-processing=true
store.executor.use-virtual-thread-for-event-processing=true
```


### Optional Configuration
The followings are optional configuration. You can leave them as-is and jump to the next section [Running the application](#running-the-application)

#### Genesis files Configuration for custom networks

This is only required if you are using any **custom** networks. For following public networks, the genesis files are already available in the application.
- mainnet
- preprod
- preview
- sanchonet


Configure genesis files location for custom network

```
store.cardano.byron-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/cardano-node/files/byron-genesis.json
store.cardano.shelley-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/cardano-node/files/shelley-genesis.json
store.cardano.alonzo-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/work/cardano-node/preprod/files/alonzo-genesis.json
store.cardano.conway-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/work/cardano-node/preprod/files/conway-genesis.json
```

#### N2C Configuration

The following properties are required for node-to-client (n2c) communication. This is required for transaction submission,
fetching protocol parameters etc. If you don't need these functionalities, you can leave them as-is.
```
#store.cardano.n2c-node-socket-path=/Users/satya/work/cardano-node/preprod-8.1.2/db/node.socket

# If you are accessing n2c through a relay like "socat", uncomment and edit the following properties.
#store.cardano.n2c-host=<relay_host>
#store.cardano.n2c-port=<relay_port>
```

#### Enable / Disable specific store

Even if you are using ``yaci-store-all`` application, you can enable/disable specific stores. **For example**, if you want to disable utxo store, you can do so by setting the following property to false.

```
store.utxo.enabled=false
```

This property is available for all stores.

```
store.<store_name></store_name>.enabled=false
```

#### Starting from a specific point

By default, sync starts from the genesis block. If you want to start from a specific point, you can do so by setting the following property.

```
store.cardano.sync-start-slot=2738868
store.cardano.sync-start-blockhash=a5c72a0e74cf066873ae7741c488acaef32746e1c4ac3b0d49c4acf4add1a47c

# For Byron block as start  point
#store.cardano.sync-start-byron-block-number=2737340

# For stop point
#store.cardano.sync-stop-slot=76667163
#store.cardano.sync-stop-blockhash=3e9a93afb174503befd4e8dabd52f73e6c4e9c3c76886713475dd43b00e6acbf
