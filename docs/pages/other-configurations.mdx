## Other configurations

Each store implementation in yaci-store has its own configuration options. We will try to highlight a few key configurations here.
These store-specific configurations can be set in the `application.properties` file.

### Pruning Configuration

Sometimes you may not want to store all historical data in a store. If you are using yaci-store as a library, you can customize it
to only store specific data in your own custom storage implementation. However, if you want to delete historical data from a store database, you can use the pruning configuration.

Currently, pruning configuration is only supported for the following stores. In the future, we will add support for other stores as well.
- utxo
- transaction

<Callout>
**By default, pruning is disabled for all stores.**
</Callout>

#### Utxo Pruning

To enable utxo pruning, you can set the following configurations in the `application.properties` file.

```properties
store.utxo.pruning-enabled=true
store.utxo.pruning.interval=600
```

The above configuration will run utxo pruning every 600 seconds.

There is also another configuration, `store.utxo.pruning-safe-blocks`, which can be used to specify the number of safe blocks to keep in the store.
By default, this is set to 2160 blocks, same as the security parameter in Cardano mainnet.

#### Transaction Pruning

To enable transaction pruning, you can set the following configurations in the `application.properties` file.

```properties
store.transaction.pruning-enabled=true
store.transaction.pruning.interval=86400
```

#### Epoch Stake Pruning
To enable epoch stake pruning, you can set the following configurations in the `application.properties` file.

```properties
store.adapot.epoch-stake-pruning-enabled=true
store.adapot.epoch-stake-pruning-interval=86400
```

The above configuration will run transaction pruning every 86400 seconds or 1 day.

There is also another configuration, `store.adapot.epoch-stake-safe-epochs`, which can be used to specify the number of safe epochs to keep in the store.
By default, this is set to 4 epochs.

#### Reward Pruning

To enable reward pruning, add the following configurations to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
store.adapot.reward-pruning-enabled=true
store.adapot.reward-pruning-interval=86400
```

The above configuration will run reward pruning every 86400 seconds (1 day)

You can also specify how many safe slots to keep in the reward table using:

```properties
store.adapot.reward-pruning-safe-slots=43200
```

By default, this is set to 43200 slots. Reward records are eligible for pruning if their corresponding withdrawal occurred at a slot less than or equal to the latest slot minus this safe slot threshold.
Rewards that have not been withdrawn will never be pruned.

<Callout>
Reward pruning will only remove reward records that have already been withdrawn (i.e., there is a withdrawal after the reward's slot for the same address). Rewards that have not been withdrawn will never be pruned.
</Callout>

### Transaction Witness Saving

The transaction store supports configurable saving of witness data. This feature allows you to enable or disable the saving of transaction witnesses in the database,
which can help reduce storage requirements if witness data is not required for your use case.
By default, saving of transaction witness data is disabled.

```properties
store.transaction.save-witness=false
```
## Auto Sync off

Ideally, you should only have one write instance of yaci-store. However, if you want to set up multiple read-only yaci-store instances alongside one write instance,
you can disable auto-sync in the read-only instances. This way, the read-only instances will only read from the database and not write to it.

```properties
store.sync-auto-start=false
```

## Store specific application

Yaci Store bundles all stores by default, and you can enable or disable stores by setting a store-specific enable flag in the application.properties file.
This makes it possible to have multiple instances of yaci-store with different stores enabled. These individual instances can write to their own separate databases with the default configuration.

However, if you want to have multiple store-specific yaci-store applications writing to the same database, each application needs to maintain its own **cursor** in the `cursor_` table.

This is achievable by assigning a unique event publisher ID to each yaci-store application. This can be done by setting the following configuration in each application's `application.properties` file.

```properties
store.event-publisher-id=1000  //some unique id
```
