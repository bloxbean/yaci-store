# Stores Overview

## Introduction

Yaci Store is built on a modular architecture where different types of blockchain data are organized into separate modules called "stores". This design provides flexibility, scalability, and allows users to enable only the functionality they need.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each store is independent and can be enabled/disabled based on requirements
2. **Event-Driven**: Stores react to blockchain events (blocks, transactions, etc.) published by the sync engine
3. **Parallel Processing**: Core stores process data in parallel for optimal performance
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin framework allows customization without modifying core code

### Data Flow

```
Cardano Node → Sync → Event Publisher →  Processors →  Storage implementations → Database
                                             ↓                         ↓
                                      Plugin Framework         Plugin Framework
```

## Store Categories

### Core Stores

These stores handle fundamental blockchain data and are enabled by default:

- **Assets Store**: Manages native tokens, NFTs, and fungible tokens
- **Blocks Store**: Stores block-related information
- **Epoch Store**: Tracks epoch parameters, and epoch-specific data
- **Governance Store**: Handles governance actions, proposals, votes, and DRep data
- **Metadata Store**: Stores transaction metadata
- **MIR Store**: Processes Move Instantaneous Rewards certificates
- **Script Store**: Manages Plutus scripts, native scripts, and script references
- **Staking Store**: Tracks stake pools, delegations, registrations, and rewards
- **Transaction Store**: Stores transaction data
- **UTxO Store**: Manages unspent transaction outputs and spending relationships

### Aggregation Modules

These modules perform complex calculations and are disabled by default:

- **Account**: Calculates and maintains address balances over time
- **Adapot**: Tracks ADA distribution across different pots (treasury, reserves, etc.) and calculate rewards
- **Governance Aggregation**: Calculate governance-related state
- **Epoch Aggregation**: Aggregates epoch level data
