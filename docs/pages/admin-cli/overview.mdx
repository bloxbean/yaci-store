# Admin CLI Overview

The Yaci Store Admin CLI is a command-line interface tool designed for database administration and maintenance tasks. It provides essential commands for managing indexes and performing rollback operations on your Yaci Store database.

## What is Admin CLI?

Admin CLI is a Spring Shell-based application that allows you to:

- **Manage Database Indexes**: Apply and verify database indexes for optimal read performance
- **Rollback Data**: Safely rollback your database to a previous epoch when needed
- **Database Maintenance**: Perform various database maintenance operations

## Key Features

### 1. Index Management
- Apply default indexes required for read operations
- Apply optional extra indexes for enhanced performance
- Verify existing indexes and identify missing ones

### 2. Rollback Operations
- Rollback all data to a specific epoch
- Rollback ledger state data independently
- Configurable rollback behavior through YAML files
- Safety validations and pruning warnings

## When to Use Admin CLI

### Index Management Scenarios
- After initial database sync to optimize read performance
- When adding new stores or modules that require additional indexes
- During performance tuning and optimization

### Rollback Scenarios
- **Data Correction**: When you need to resync from a specific point due to data inconsistencies
- **Testing & Development**: Rolling back to test different scenarios
- **Recovery**: Recovering from sync errors or corrupted data

<Callout type="warning">
Always backup your database before performing rollback operations. Rollback is a destructive operation and cannot be undone without a backup.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before using Admin CLI, ensure you have:

1. **Yaci Store database** properly configured and synced
2. **Database access credentials** configured
3. **Docker** (for Docker distribution) or **Java 21+** (for non-Docker distribution)
4. **Understanding of Cardano concepts**: epochs, slots, and blocks

## Available Commands

The Admin CLI provides the following command groups:

### Database Commands (`db` group)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `apply-indexes` | Apply default indexes for read operations |
| `apply-extra-indexes` | Apply additional optional indexes |
| `verify-indexes` | List missing indexes |
| `rollback-data` | Rollback data to a previous epoch |
| `rollback-ledger-state-data` | Rollback ledger state data to a previous epoch |

## Getting Started

To use the Admin CLI, you'll need to:

1. Download Yaci Store distribution (Docker or non-Docker ZIP)
2. Configure your database connection
3. Run Admin CLI using the provided wrapper script
