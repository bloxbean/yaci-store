# Getting Started with Yaci Store 2.0.0-beta1

> **Note**: This documentation is for the **2.0.0-beta1** release. For the latest 2.x.x version, see the [main Getting Started guide](./getting-started-2.x.x.mdx).

This was the **first beta release of Yaci Store with ledger-state support**. Yaci Store can now **calculate and derive ledger state**—such as **rewards**, **ADAPot**, and **governance state**—from **on-chain data**.

Unlike DB Sync, which receives ledger events directly from a local Cardano Node (both implemented in Haskell), **Yaci Store independently computes all required ledger state from the on-chain data itself.**

---

## Status of Ledger State Data Accuracy (Beta1)

Ledger State calculations include:
- Epoch Stake and Rewards
- ADAPot values
- Governance State (dRep distribution, Proposal Status, dRep Status)

### Reward Calculation and ADAPot Status

- **Mainnet**:
  - ADAPots and rewards match up to epoch 545.
  - Mismatch in epoch 546:
    - Treasury: **-0.065 ADA** (-62,510 lovelace)
    - Reserves: **35.5 ADA** (35,580,032 lovelace)
  - _Note: This could be due to an incorrect status for the New Constitution governance action._

- **Preprod**:
  - ADAPots and rewards match up to epoch 212 (current epoch at the time of writing).

- **Preview**:
  - ADAPots and rewards match up to epoch 916 (current epoch at the time of writing).

A few dRep distribution mismatches (for 5 dReps) were found on the Preview network during some earlier epochs.

> 🔎 Mismatch details for all public networks can be found [here](./ledger-state-mismatches.mdx).
>
> ⚠️ We also identified **some incorrect `DRep expiry` values** in Preprod and Preview. See [issue #536](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store/issues/536).
>
> 🛠 We will address these issues in the next beta and continue to monitor results alongside DB Sync and the Cardano Node for upcoming epochs.

---

> **Note:**
>
> If you're testing ledger-state calculation, we recommend starting with **Preview** or **Preprod** networks for this release.
>
> For mainnet, you may also need to **tune your PostgreSQL configuration** though the default config will work but will take longer.
In the next beta release we will provide the postgres configuration for mainnet sync.

---

## Known Issues or Limitations

1. **Performance of Reward Calculation on Mainnet**
   - Ledger-state calculations currently happen **during epoch transition**.
     That means **rewards paid in epoch X are calculated during the transition from epoch X-1 to X**.
   - On Mainnet, this takes around **20–40 minutes** per transition (depends on your PostgreSQL resources).
   - In a future release, we plan to start **reward calculation in epoch X-1 after the stability window**, similar to how the Haskell node works.
     This will reduce the computation load during epoch boundaries.

---

## Out-of-the-Box Applications

### 1. **Yaci Store App**
- The **default indexer application**, includes all modules.
- **Ledger-state calculation is disabled by default** but can be enabled via profile.

### 2. **Ledger State App**
- Contains only the modules needed for **ledger-state calculation**.
- Excludes modules like metadata and script that are unnecessary for this purpose.

### 3. **Yaci Store Admin CLI App**
- CLI tool to **apply optional indexes after sync is complete**.
- Optional indexes improve API query performance and are not applied during initial sync.

---

## Types of Distribution

Yaci Store provides three types of distributions:

1. **Yaci Store Zip Distribution (JARs)**
2. **Yaci Store Docker Distribution**
3. **Yaci Store Native (GraalVM) Distribution** *(Preview)*

---

### 1. Yaci Store Zip Distribution (JARs)

Filename: `yaci-store-<version>.zip`

Includes:
- `yaci-store.jar`
- `yaci-store-ledger-state.jar`
- Config files (`application.properties`)

#### Pre-requisites

- Java 21 or Java 24 (Recommended)

You can use [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) to install Java 21 or 24.

```bash
sdk install java 24.0.1-tem
sdk use java 24.0.1-tem
```

Check if JAVA_HOME env variable is set correctly:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

#### Edit Config

- Edit `application.properties` to set the Cardano network and Database connection settings
- Check the following properties and update them accordingly
```
store.cardano.host=preview-node.world.dev.cardano.org
store.cardano.port=30002
store.cardano.protocol-magic=2
```

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yaci_indexer?currentSchema=preview
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
```

#### Usage

- **To run Yaci Store (without ledger-state):**
  ```bash
  ./bin/start.sh
  ```

- **To enable ledger-state calculation with all other on-chain data:**
  ```bash
  ./bin/start.sh ledger-state
  ```

- **To run Ledger State App only:**
  ```bash
  ./bin/start-ledger-state.sh
  ```

**If ledger state is enabled, verify the log message to ensure that ledger-state calculation is active**

While running Yaci Store with ledger-state calculation enabled, you may see logs similar to the example below, indicating
that address balance calculation is active — which is required for ledger-state calculation.

```
 # of blocks written: 100, Time taken: 25 ms
Block No: 4746  , Era: Shelley
### Starting account balance calculation upto block: 4846 ###
 	Total Stake Address Balance records 0, Time taken to save: 0
 	Time taken to delete stake address balance history: 0
### Total balance processing and saving time 1 ###

 # of blocks written: 100, Time taken: 28 ms
 Block No: 4846  , Era: Shelley
### Starting account balance calculation upto block: 4946 ###
 	Total Stake Address Balance records 0, Time taken to save: 0
 	Time taken to delete stake address balance history: 0
### Total balance processing and saving time 1 ###
```

#### 1.1 Apply Optional Indexes

After the initial sync is complete:

```bash
./bin/yaci-cli.sh
```

This launches the Admin CLI (`yaci-store-admin-cli.jar`). At the CLI prompt:

```bash
yaci-store> apply-indexes
```

---

### 2. Yaci Store Docker Distribution (Beta1 Method)

> **Note**: This is the **legacy Docker distribution method** for beta1. For the latest simplified Docker distribution, see the [main Getting Started guide](./getting-started-2.x.x.mdx).

This ZIP includes Docker Compose files for:
- PostgreSQL
- Yaci Store app
- Ledger State app

You can choose between:
- **Monolith setups** (run both Postgres and indexer app)
- **App-specific setups** (connect to an external DB)

#### Usage

1. Edit `application.properties` to configure network settings.

- Check the following properties and update them accordingly
```
store.cardano.host=preview-node.world.dev.cardano.org
store.cardano.port=30002
store.cardano.protocol-magic=2
```

2. Start containers:

- **Yaci Store with Postgres**:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f yaci-store-monolith.yml up
  ```

- **Yaci Store with Postgres with ledger-state calculation**:

  - Edit `env` file and uncomment the following property

  ```
  SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=ledger-state
  ```

  - Run Yaci Store with ledger state profile

  ```bash
  docker compose -f yaci-store-monolith.yml up
  ```

- **Ledger State with Postgres**:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f yaci-store-ledger-state-monolith.yml up
  ```

- **Access PostgreSQL DB**:
  ```bash
  ./psql.sh postgres-compose.yml
  ```

**If ledger state is enabled, verify the log message to ensure that ledger-state calculation is active**

While running Yaci Store with ledger-state calculation enabled, you may see logs similar to the example below, indicating
that address balance calculation is active — which is required for ledger-state calculation.

```
 # of blocks written: 100, Time taken: 25 ms
Block No: 4746  , Era: Shelley
### Starting account balance calculation upto block: 4846 ###
 	Total Stake Address Balance records 0, Time taken to save: 0
 	Time taken to delete stake address balance history: 0
### Total balance processing and saving time 1 ###

 # of blocks written: 100, Time taken: 28 ms
 Block No: 4846  , Era: Shelley
### Starting account balance calculation upto block: 4946 ###
 	Total Stake Address Balance records 0, Time taken to save: 0
 	Time taken to delete stake address balance history: 0
### Total balance processing and saving time 1 ###
```

#### 2.1 Connects to an external PostgreSQL DB

Use docker compose file like `yaci-store.yml` or `yaci-store-ledger-state.yml` instead of `*-monolith.yml` if you want to connect to an external PostgreSQL DB.

- Edit `yaci-store.yml` or `yaci-store-ledger-state.yml` to comment the database configuration in docker compose yml.

```
#    environment:
#      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL:-jdbc:postgresql://yaci-store-postgres:5432/yaci_store?currentSchema=yaci_store}
#      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME:-yaci}
#      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD:-dbpass}
```

- Edit `application.properties` to set the database connection settings.
  Make sure to use the **database host or IP address** instead of `localhost`, as the Docker container will not be able to connect to the host using `localhost`.
  Also, ensure that only the **PostgreSQL** configuration section is uncommented.

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://192.168.0.2:5432/yaci_indexer?currentSchema=preview
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
```

##### 2.1.1 Usage
- **Yaci Store**:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f yaci-store.yml up
  ```

- **Yaci Store with ledger-state calculation**:

  - Edit `env` file and uncomment the following property

  ```
  SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=ledger-state
  ```

  - Run Yaci Store with ledger state profile

  ```bash
  docker compose -f yaci-store.yml up
  ```

- **Ledger State with Postgres**:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f yaci-store-ledger-state.yml up
  ```

#### 2.2 Apply Indexes After Sync

- Open `admin-cli.sh` and replace `${tag}` with the actual version number and correct image name.
  _(This is a known bug and will be fixed in the next release.)_

Example:

```
docker run -it --volume ./application.properties:/app/config/application.properties bloxbean/yaci-store-admin-cli:2.0.0-beta1
```

- Edit `application.properties` to set the database connection settings.
  Make sure to use the **database host or IP address** instead of `localhost`, as the `admin-cli` Docker container will not be able to connect to the host using `localhost`.
  Also, ensure that only the **PostgreSQL** configuration section is uncommented.

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://192.168.0.142:54333/yaci_store?currentSchema=yaci_store
spring.datasource.username=yaci
spring.datasource.password=dbpass
```

Once sync is complete:

```bash
./admin-cli.sh
```

This runs the Admin CLI in a container. Then, at the prompt:

```bash
yaci-store> apply-indexes
```

---
