## Technical Integration Patterns

These projects demonstrate various integration patterns with Yaci Store:

- **API Gateway Pattern**: Cardano Rosetta uses Yaci Store as a data layer for standardized blockchain APIs
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: FluidTokens leverages the event system for real-time token tracking
- **Analytics Pipeline**: SundaeSwap Analytics uses selective stores for focused DeFi data
- **Microservices**: AdaHandle Resolver runs as a lightweight service with minimal stores enabled
- **Governance Infrastructure**: Ballot and Reeve platforms utilize governance stores for on-chain voting
- **Automation Workflows**: AdaMatic integrates multiple stores for complex blockchain interactions
