# Auto Sync off

Ideally, you should only have one write instance of yaci-store. However, if you want to set up multiple read-only yaci-store instances alongside one write instance,
you can disable auto-sync in the read-only instances. This way, the read-only instances will only read from the database and not write to it.

```properties
store.sync-auto-start=false
```

## Store specific application

Yaci Store bundles all stores by default, and you can enable or disable stores by setting a store-specific enable flag in the application.properties file.
This makes it possible to have multiple instances of yaci-store with different stores enabled. These individual instances can write to their own separate databases with the default configuration.

However, if you want to have multiple store-specific yaci-store applications writing to the same database, each application needs to maintain its own **cursor** in the `cursor_` table.

This is achievable by assigning a unique event publisher ID to each yaci-store application. This can be done by setting the following configuration in each application's `application.properties` file.

```properties
store.event-publisher-id=1000  //some unique id
```
