## General Questions

### Why does the `utxo` column in the `adapot` table always show 0?

<Callout type="info">
The `utxo` column in the `adapot` table currently contains a default value of 0. This is a **planned feature** that will be implemented in a future release.
</Callout>

**Current workaround:**

No action is required. The default value does not affect the accuracy of other ledger state calculations, including rewards, treasury, and reserves.

## Troubleshooting

### What's the first thing I should do when encountering data discrepancy errors during synchronization?

<Callout type="info">
When you encounter data-related errors or discrepancies during synchronization, the **first recommended action** is to use the **Rollback CLI** to restore your database to a known good state.
</Callout>

**Why rollback first?**

Data discrepancies can occur for various reasons - network issues, interrupted synchronization, or edge cases in data processing. Rather than waiting for a fix or troubleshooting extensively, rolling back to a stable epoch allows you to:

- **Quickly restore operations** to a working state
- **Isolate the problematic epoch** to better understand the issue
- **Continue synchronization** from a clean checkpoint
- **Provide better bug reports** with specific epoch information

**How to perform a rollback:**

The **Yaci Store Admin CLI** provides a straightforward rollback feature:

1. **Stop the Yaci Store application** to prevent further synchronization

2. **Identify the last known good epoch** (check your logs or database state before the error occurred)

3. **Run the rollback command:**
   ```bash
   java -jar yaci-store-admin-cli.jar rollback --epoch <EPOCH_NUMBER>
   ```
   Replace `<EPOCH_NUMBER>` with the epoch you want to roll back to.

4. **Verify the rollback** by checking your database state

5. **Restart Yaci Store** and monitor the synchronization process

**After rolling back:**

- **Monitor the logs carefully** as synchronization resumes
- If the error persists at the same epoch, check the [Known Issues](../ledger-state-mismatches) page
- Report the issue with specific epoch and error details to help improve Yaci Store
- Consider enabling debug logging for more detailed diagnostics

**Best practices:**

- Maintain regular database backups
- Document the epoch where errors occur for future reference
- Test rollback procedures in non-production environments first
- Keep your Yaci Store version up to date to benefit from the latest fixes
