# Yaci Store 2.0.0-beta5 Installation

Yaci Store provides three types of distributions to suit different deployment needs:

## Types of Distribution

### 1. [Docker Distribution](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/beta5/docker) **(Recommended)**

Complete environment with PostgreSQL, admin tools, and monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana). Perfect for production deployments and quick setup.

**Best for:**
- Production deployments
- Quick start and evaluation
- Complete monitoring and management capabilities

---

### 2. [Zip Distribution (JARs)](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/beta5/zip)

Standalone JAR files with configuration files. Provides maximum flexibility for custom setups and enterprise deployments.

**Best for:**
- Custom database configurations
- Enterprise deployment pipelines
- Advanced users requiring full control

### 3. [Native (GraalVM) Distribution](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/beta5/native) *(Preview)*

Native binaries compiled with GraalVM for optimal performance and reduced resource usage.

**Best for:**
- Performance-critical deployments
- Resource-constrained environments
- Testing native compilation capabilities

## Known Issues or Limitations

1. **Performance of Reward Calculation on Mainnet**
   - Ledger-state calculations currently happen **during epoch transition**.
     That means **rewards paid in epoch X are calculated during the transition from epoch X-1 to X**.
   - On Mainnet, this takes around **15–30 minutes** per transition (depends on your PostgreSQL resources).
   - In a future release, we plan to start **reward calculation in epoch X-1 after the stability window**, similar to how the Haskell node works.
     This will reduce the computation load during epoch boundaries.
