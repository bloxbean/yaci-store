# Getting Started with Yaci Store 2.x.x

## Current Version: 2.0.0

This is the **latest release of Yaci Store with ledger-state support**. Yaci Store can now **calculate and derive ledger state**—such as **rewards**, **ADAPot**, and **governance state**—from **on-chain data**.

Unlike DB Sync, which receives ledger events directly from a local Cardano Node (both implemented in Haskell), **Yaci Store independently computes all required ledger state from the on-chain data itself.**

---

## Status of Ledger State Data Accuracy

Ledger State calculations include:
- Epoch Stake and Rewards
- ADAPot values
- Governance State (dRep distribution, Proposal Status, dRep Status)

### Reward Calculation and ADAPot Status

ADAPot values match across all 3 public networks:
- **Mainnet**: Verified through epoch 610
- **Preprod**: Verified through epoch 268
- **Preview**: Verified through epoch 1196

We will update this section with any discrepancies for future mismatches.

### Governance State Data

Governance action proposal statuses match across all 3 public networks:
- **Mainnet**: Verified through epoch 610
- **Preprod**: Verified through epoch 268
- **Preview**: Verified through epoch 1196

However, there are some known mismatches in dRep distribution and dRep `active_until` values. For  the latest mismatch reports, see [the 2.0.0 mismatch summary](../ledger-state-mismatches/2-0-0/overview). We will be working on fixing these in future releases.

## Out-of-the-Box Applications

### 1. **Yaci Store App**
- The **default indexer application**, includes all modules.
- **Ledger-state calculation is disabled by default** but can be enabled via profile.

### 2. **Yaci Store Admin CLI App**
- CLI tool to **apply optional indexes after sync is complete**.
- Optional indexes improve API query performance and are not applied during initial sync.
- Supports rollback to a previous epoch
