# Getting Started with Yaci Store 2.x.x

## Current Version: 2.0.0

This is the **latest release of Yaci Store with ledger-state support**. Yaci Store can now **calculate and derive ledger state**—such as **rewards**, **ADAPot**, and **governance state**—from **on-chain data**.

Unlike DB Sync, which receives ledger events directly from a local Cardano Node (both implemented in Haskell), **Yaci Store independently computes all required ledger state from the on-chain data itself.**

## Status of Ledger State Data Accuracy

Ledger State calculations include:
- Epoch Stake and Rewards
- ADAPot values
- Governance State (dRep distribution, Proposal Status, dRep Status)

### Reward Calculation and ADAPot Status

ADAPot values are matching for all 3 public networks up to the recent epochs:
- **Mainnet**: Up to epoch 595 (recent epoch when this document was written)
- **Preprod**: Up to epoch 253 (recent epoch when this document was written)
- **Preview**: Up to epoch 1121 (recent epoch when this document was written)

We will update this section with any discrepancies for future mismatches.

### Governance State Data

Governance action proposal statuses are correctly calculated up to recent epochs and are matching. However, there are some known mismatches in dRep distribution and dRep `active_until` values. For a detailed breakdown and the latest mismatch reports, see [the 2.0.0-beta5 mismatch summary](../../ledger-state-mismatches/2-0-0-beta5/2-0-0-beta5). We will be working on fixing these in future releases.

## Beta Release Status

Except for governance state and reward data, all other stores are production-ready and can be used in production environments.

While governance state data calculation has some mismatches, and even though reward/epoch stake data are all correct, we are keeping the beta label for now. There will be a few more beta releases while we fix all issues in the ledger state. Meanwhile, you can use other stores (UTXO, block, metadata, etc.) in production.

## Out-of-the-Box Applications

### 1. **Yaci Store App**
- The **default indexer application**, includes all modules.
- **Ledger-state calculation is disabled by default** but can be enabled via profile.

### 2. **Yaci Store Admin CLI App**
- CLI tool to **apply optional indexes after sync is complete**.
- Optional indexes improve API query performance and are not applied during initial sync.
- Supports rollback to a previous epoch
