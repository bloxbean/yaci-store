# Getting Started with Yaci Store 2.0.0-beta1

> **Note**: This documentation is for the **2.0.0-beta1** release. For the latest 2.x.x version, see the [main Getting Started guide](./getting-started-2.x.x.mdx).

This was the **first beta release of Yaci Store with ledger-state support**. Yaci Store can now **calculate and derive ledger state**—such as **rewards**, **ADAPot**, and **governance state**—from **on-chain data**.

Unlike DB Sync, which receives ledger events directly from a local Cardano Node (both implemented in Haskell), **Yaci Store independently computes all required ledger state from the on-chain data itself.**

---

## Status of Ledger State Data Accuracy (Beta1)

Ledger State calculations include:
- Epoch Stake and Rewards
- ADAPot values
- Governance State (dRep distribution, Proposal Status, dRep Status)

### Reward Calculation and ADAPot Status

- **Mainnet**:
- ADAPots and rewards match up to epoch 545.
- Mismatch in epoch 546:
- Treasury: **-0.065 ADA** (-62,510 lovelace)
- Reserves: **35.5 ADA** (35,580,032 lovelace)
- _Note: This could be due to an incorrect status for the New Constitution governance action._

- **Preprod**:
- ADAPots and rewards match up to epoch 212 (current epoch at the time of writing).

- **Preview**:
- ADAPots and rewards match up to epoch 916 (current epoch at the time of writing).

A few dRep distribution mismatches (for 5 dReps) were found on the Preview network during some earlier epochs.

> 🔎 Mismatch details for all public networks can be found [here](../ledger-state-mismatches/2-0-0-beta1/2-0-0-beta1.mdx)..
>
> ⚠️ We also identified **some incorrect `DRep expiry` values** in Preprod and Preview. See [issue #536](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store/issues/536).
>
> 🛠 We will address these issues in the next beta and continue to monitor results alongside DB Sync and the Cardano Node for upcoming epochs.

> **Note:**
>
> If you're testing ledger-state calculation, we recommend starting with **Preview** or **Preprod** networks for this release.
>
> For mainnet, you may also need to **tune your PostgreSQL configuration** though the default config will work but will take longer.
In the next beta release we will provide the postgres configuration for mainnet sync.

## Known Issues or Limitations

1. **Performance of Reward Calculation on Mainnet**
- Ledger-state calculations currently happen **during epoch transition**.
That means **rewards paid in epoch X are calculated during the transition from epoch X-1 to X**.
- On Mainnet, this takes around **20–40 minutes** per transition (depends on your PostgreSQL resources).
- In a future release, we plan to start **reward calculation in epoch X-1 after the stability window**, similar to how the Haskell node works.
This will reduce the computation load during epoch boundaries.

## Out-of-the-Box Applications

### 1. **Yaci Store App**
- The **default indexer application**, includes all modules.
- **Ledger-state calculation is disabled by default** but can be enabled via profile.

### 2. **Ledger State App**
- Contains only the modules needed for **ledger-state calculation**.
- Excludes modules like metadata and script that are unnecessary for this purpose.

### 3. **Yaci Store Admin CLI App**
- CLI tool to **apply optional indexes after sync is complete**.
- Optional indexes improve API query performance and are not applied during initial sync.
