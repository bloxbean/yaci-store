# Use out-of-the-box indexer application

Yaci Store comes with an out-of-the-box indexer application with all modules included in it. Apart from ledger state modules like adapot and governance-aggr, all other modules or stores are enabled by default.
Based on your use case, you can enable or disable different stores by changing the configuration.

For details on how to install yaci store out-of-the-box applications, please refer to the [Installation](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/docker) section.

## Configuration

You can find configuration file `application.properties` in the `config` directory.

### Mandatory Configuration

#### Network Configuration

```
store.cardano.host=preprod-node.world.dev.cardano.org
store.cardano.port=30000
store.cardano.protocol-magic=1
```

#### Database Configuration

Uncomment and edit the following properties to configure the database connection.

```
spring.datasource.url=
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=
```

Additional configurations for database connection pool and batch insert.

```shell
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=50
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=100
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_inserts=true
```

#### Parallel Processing Configuration

The following properties are used to configure parallel processing. You can leave them as-is or change them based on
your machine configuration.

**Note:** If you are using parallel processing, you also need to configure the database connection pool size accordingly.

```
store.executor.enable-parallel-processing=true

store.executor.blocks-batch-size=200
store.executor.blocks-partition-size=10

store.executor.use-virtual-thread-for-batch-processing=true
store.executor.use-virtual-thread-for-event-processing=true
```


### Optional Configuration
The following are optional configurations.

#### Genesis files Configuration for custom networks

This is only required if you are using any **custom** networks. For following public networks, the genesis files are already available in the application.
- mainnet
- preprod
- preview


Configure genesis files location for custom network

```
store.cardano.byron-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/cardano-node/files/byron-genesis.json
store.cardano.shelley-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/cardano-node/files/shelley-genesis.json
store.cardano.alonzo-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/work/cardano-node/preprod/files/alonzo-genesis.json
store.cardano.conway-genesis-file=/Users/xyz/work/cardano-node/preprod/files/conway-genesis.json
```

#### N2C Configuration

The following properties are required for node-to-client (n2c) communication. This is required for transaction submission,
fetching protocol parameters etc. If you don't need these functionalities, you can leave them as-is.
```
#store.cardano.n2c-node-socket-path=/Users/satya/work/cardano-node/preprod-8.1.2/db/node.socket

# If you are accessing n2c through a relay like "socat", uncomment and edit the following properties.
#store.cardano.n2c-host=<relay_host>
#store.cardano.n2c-port=<relay_port>
```

#### Enable / Disable specific store

Even if you are using ``yaci-store-all`` application, you can enable/disable specific stores. **For example**, if you want to disable utxo store, you can do so by setting the following property to false.

```
store.utxo.enabled=false
```

This property is available for all stores.

```
store.<store_name></store_name>.enabled=false
```

#### Starting from a specific point

By default, sync starts from the genesis block. If you want to start from a specific point, you can do so by setting the following property.

```
store.cardano.sync-start-slot=2738868
store.cardano.sync-start-blockhash=a5c72a0e74cf066873ae7741c488acaef32746e1c4ac3b0d49c4acf4add1a47c

# For Byron block as start  point
#store.cardano.sync-start-byron-block-number=2737340

# For stop point
#store.cardano.sync-stop-slot=76667163
#store.cardano.sync-stop-blockhash=3e9a93afb174503befd4e8dabd52f73e6c4e9c3c76886713475dd43b00e6acbf
```

## Swagger UI

By default, swagger UI for the application is available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

## DB Indexes (After Initial Sync)

After the initial sync is complete, you can create additional optional indexes to improve query performance of out-of-box REST APIs. To create optional indexes,
check installation section for more details: [Installation](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/docker#apply-indexes)
