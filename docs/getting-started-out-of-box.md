## Use out-of-the-box applications

Yaci Store comes with few applications that you can use out-of-the-box. These applications are designed to be used as-is.

- **yaci-store-all:** This application bundles all available modules/stores into a single application. If you want to index all available data, this is the application you want.
- **yaci-store-utxo-indexer:** This application contains utxo store,  protocolparams store and submit module If you want a utxo indexer with transaction submission capability, this is the application you want.
- **yaci-store-aggregation-app:** This application handles aggregation tasks like account balance calculation. This can be run as a separate application to calculate address balances.
For steps to run this application, please refer to [Aggregation App Getting Started](aggregation-app-getting-started.md) section.

The Jar files for these applications are available in the release section.
