# Tracking UTXOs for a Specific Address

## Introduction

Welcome to your first hands-on tutorial with Yaci Store! In this guide, you'll learn how to set up a lightweight Cardano indexer that tracks transactions and UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) for a specific address.

**What is Yaci Store?**
Yaci Store is a Cardano blockchain indexer that reads data from the blockchain and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. Think of it as a specialized tool that helps you extract and organize blockchain data for your applications.

**What will you build?**
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a running Yaci Store instance that:
- Synchronizes with the Cardano blockchain
- Tracks UTXOs only for one specific address (ignoring everything else)
- Stores the data in an easily queryable database
- Optionally sends you Discord notifications when the address balance changes

**Why is this useful?**
Instead of indexing the entire Cardano blockchain (which requires significant storage and processing power), you can focus on just the data you need. This is perfect for:
- Monitoring a treasury wallet
- Tracking payments to a specific address
- Building lightweight applications that only care about one address
- Development and testing with minimal resource requirements

**What you'll learn:**
- How to set up Yaci Store using Docker
- How to configure and enable plugins
- How to write custom filtering logic
- How to query blockchain data from the database

Let's get started!

---

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- **Docker and Docker Compose** installed on your system
  - [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Mac or Windows
  - [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for Linux
- **Basic familiarity** with Cardano addresses
- **Estimated time:** 20-30 minutes

<Callout type="info">
This tutorial uses the Cardano **preprod** testnet, which is perfect for learning without dealing with real ADA or requiring extensive storage.
</Callout>

---

## Step 1: Download Yaci Store

First, let's get the Yaci Store Docker distribution.

1. **Download the latest release**

   Visit the [Yaci Store releases page](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store/releases) and download the Docker distribution archive (look for `yaci-store-docker-<version>.zip`).

   For example: `yaci-store-docker-2.0.0-beta5.zip`

2. **Extract the archive**

   ```bash
   # For .tar.gz files
   unzip yaci-store-docker-<version>.zip
   cd yaci-store-docker-<version>
   ```

3. **Explore the directory structure**

   You should see the following files and folders:

   ```
   yaci-store/
   ├── yaci-store.sh          # Main script to start/stop Yaci Store
   ├── admin-cli.sh           # Admin operations
   ├── monitoring.sh          # Optional monitoring stack
   ├── psql.sh                # Quick database access
   ├── LICENSE                # License
   ├── compose/              # Docker compose files
   │   ├── .env             # Docker image versions
   │   ├── admin-cli-compose.yml
   │   ├── monitoring.yml
   │   ├── postgres-compose.yml
   │   ├── postgres-compose-minimal.yml
   │   ├── yaci-store.yml
   │   └── yaci-store-monolith.yml
   ├── config/              # Configuration files
   │   ├── env              # Environment variables
   │   ├── application.properties
   │   ├── application-ledger-state.properties
   │   └── application-plugins.yml
   └── plugins/      # Where we'll put our custom plugins
       ├── ext-jars
       └── scripts
   ```

<Callout type="info">
The `yaci-store.sh` script is your main interface. It handles starting, stopping, and managing the Docker containers for you.
</Callout>

---

## Step 2: Configure Network Connection

Now let's configure Yaci Store to connect to the Cardano preprod testnet.

1. **Edit the main configuration file**

   Open `config/application.properties` in your text editor.

2. **Set the network connection**

   Find the Cardano network configuration section and set these values:

   ```properties
   # Cardano Network Configuration
   store.cardano.host=preprod-node.play.dev.cardano.org
   store.cardano.port=3001
   store.cardano.protocol-magic=1
   ```

   **What do these settings mean?**
   - `host`: The Cardano node you'll connect to (we're using a public preprod node)
   - `port`: The port number for the node connection
   - `protocol-magic`: Network identifier (1 = preprod, 2 = preview, 764824073 = mainnet)

3. **Verify database settings**

   The Docker distribution comes pre-configured for database access. You should see:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://yaci-store-postgres:5432/yaci_store?currentSchema=yaci_store
   spring.datasource.username=yaci
   spring.datasource.password=dbpass
   ```

   <Callout type="warning">
   These are development credentials. For production use, change the database password!
   </Callout>

---

## Step 3: Optimize for Address Tracking

Since we only want to track one address, let's disable stores we don't need. This dramatically reduces resource usage.

1. **Continue editing `config/application.properties`**

2. **Disable unnecessary stores**

   Add or modify these settings:

   ```properties
   # Disable stores we don't need
    store.assets.enabled=false
    store.blocks.enabled=false
    store.epoch.enabled=false
    store.metadata.enabled=false
    store.mir.enabled=false
    store.script.enabled=false
    store.staking.enabled=false
    store.transaction.enabled=false
    store.governance.enabled=false

    # Keep the UTXO store enabled (we need this!)
    store.utxo.enabled=true
   ```

3. **Set a recent starting point** (optional but recommended)

   Instead of syncing from the beginning of the blockchain, we can start from a recent point. However, to get accurate balance or UTXOs for your selected address, you need to choose a point before the first transaction of that address. If it's a new address with no transactions, you can select the current tip.

   The following configuration is based on the example address used in this tutorial. Change these values according to your selected address.

   ```properties
   # Start syncing from a recent slot (adjust to current preprod slot)
   store.cardano.sync-start-slot=107754724
   store.cardano.sync-start-blockhash=534d3c2d1c3915523ea8843449dd91fcf4d647719d9ef2dc64a97d47be39447b
   ```

   <Callout type="info">
   To get the latest preprod slot and block hash, visit [Cardano Explorer (Preprod)](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/) or use a recent block. This allows you to start syncing quickly without processing historical data.
   </Callout>

4. **Save the file**

---

## Step 4: Enable the Plugin System

Yaci Store uses a plugin system to extend its functionality. Let's enable it.

### 4.1 Enable Plugin Loading

1. **Edit `config/env`**

   Find and uncomment (remove the `#` at the beginning) this line:

   ```bash
   JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=${JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS} -Dloader.path=plugins,plugins/lib,plugins/ext-jars
   ```

   This tells Yaci Store to load plugins from the `plugins` directory.

### 4.2 Enable Plugins in Configuration

1. **Edit `config/application-plugins.yml`**

2. **Enable the plugin system**

   Make sure this is set:

   ```yaml
   store:
     plugins:
       enabled: true
   ```

---

## Step 5: Create the Plugin Scripts

Now comes the fun part - writing the JavaScript plugins that will filter UTXOs by address!

We'll create three plugin files:

### 5.1 Create the Address Filter

1. **Create a new file** `plugins/scripts/filter-by-address.js`

2. **Add this code:**

   ```javascript
    /**
     * Filters a list of UTXO items by a specific address
     * @param {Array} items - List of UTXO items to filter
     * @return {Array} List of filtered UTXOs that match the address filter
     */
    function filterByAddress(items) {
      // Get the target address from configuration
        // Get the address filter from environment configuration
        const address = env.getProperty("address.filter");

        // Filter UTXOs by owner address using functional approach
        const filteredUtxos = items.filter(item => item.getOwnerAddr() === address);

        // If any UTXOs were found, update global state and log the count
        if (filteredUtxos.length > 0) {
            global_state.put("utxo.found", true);
            //console.log("Utxo found : " + filteredUtxos.length);
        }

        return filteredUtxos;
    }
   ```

   **What does this do?**
   - Gets the target address from your configuration
   - Filters incoming UTXOs to only keep ones for that address
   - Returns the filtered list (which is what gets saved to the database)

### 5.2 Create the Commit Event Handler

1. **Create a new file** `plugins/scripts/handle-commit.js`

2. **Add this code:**

   ```javascript
   /**
     * Handles commit events by cleaning up additional transaction inputs
     *
     * APPROACH: Since tx_input records don't have address filtering and Yaci Store processes
     * blocks in parallel batches (100 blocks during initial sync, 1 block at tip), tx_input
     * records may be inserted before their corresponding UTXO entries in address_utxo table.
     * The CommitEvent is published at the end of each batch and handlers are processed
     * sequentially, making it the perfect place to delete orphaned tx_input records.
     *
     * @param {Object} event - The commit event containing metadata like slot number
    */
   function handleCommitEvent(event) {
      // Get the last processed slot from global_state, default to 0 if not set
       let last_tx_inputs_slot = global_state.get("last_tx_inputs_slot");
       if (last_tx_inputs_slot === null || last_tx_inputs_slot === undefined) {
           last_tx_inputs_slot = 0;
       }

       console.log("Deleting additional tx inputs after slot: " + last_tx_inputs_slot);

       // SQL query to delete orphaned tx_input records
       // Only deletes records that are not referenced by address_utxo table
       const sql = "DELETE FROM tx_input ti " +
               "WHERE ti.spent_at_slot > :given_slot " +
               "AND NOT EXISTS ( " +
               "  SELECT 1 FROM address_utxo au " +
               "  WHERE au.tx_hash = ti.tx_hash " +
               "    AND au.output_index = ti.output_index " +
               ")";

       // Set parameters for the SQL query
       const params = { "given_slot": last_tx_inputs_slot };

       // Execute the delete operation and get count of deleted records
       const count = named_jdbc.update(sql, params);

       // Log the number of deleted records if any were found
       if (count > 0) {
           console.log("Deleted " + count + " additional tx inputs.");
       }

       // Update the last processed slot to current event slot
       global_state.put("last_tx_inputs_slot", event.getMetadata().getSlot());

   }
   ```

   **What does this do?**
   - Deletes any transaction inputs that don't belong to our target address

### 5.3 Create the Rollback event Handler

1. **Create a new file** `plugins/scripts/handle-rollback.js`

2. **Add this code:**

   ```javascript
    function handleRollbackEvent(event) {
        //Reset last_tx_input_slot used in CommitEvent to delete additional tx inputs
        console.log("Utxo by address plugin handleRollbackEvent: " + event.getRollbackTo().getSlot());
        global_state.put("last_tx_inputs_slot", event.getRollbackTo().getSlot());
    }
   ```
### 5.4 Create the Discord Notification (Optional)

This plugin sends you a Discord message when your address balance changes!

1. **Create a new file** `plugins/scripts/notify-discord.js`

2. **Add this code:**

   ```javascript
   /**
    * Sends Discord notification when balance changes for the monitored address
    * @param {Object} event - The commit event containing metadata like block number
    */
    function sendDiscordNotificationOnBalanceChange(event) {
        const utxoFound = global_state.get("utxo.found");

        if (utxoFound !== null && utxoFound) {
             global_state.remove("utxo.found");

             // Skip sending notification if not at tip yet
             if (!event.getMetadata().isSyncMode()) {
                 return;
             }

             const address = env.getProperty("address.filter");

             const sql = "SELECT SUM(au.lovelace_amount) AS balance " +
                  "FROM address_utxo au " +
                  "WHERE au.owner_addr = :address " +
                  "AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM tx_input ti WHERE ti.tx_hash = au.tx_hash AND ti.output_index = au.output_index)";

             const params = { "address": address };

             const result = named_jdbc.queryForMap(sql, params);
             const balance = result["balance"];

             const discordUrl = env.getProperty("discord.webhook.url");

             const jsonData = {
                 "content": `💰 Unspent UTXO Balance: ${balance} Lovelace at Block: ${event.getMetadata().getBlock()}\n Address: ${address}`
             };

             const response = http.postJson(discordUrl, jsonData, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
             console.log("Discord response: " + response);
        }
    }
   ```

      **What does this do?**
       - Calculates the current balance of your address from the database
       - Formats a nice Discord embed message
       - Sends it to your Discord webhook whenever a UTXO is added

---

## Step 6: Configure the Plugins

Now let's wire up these plugins in the configuration.

1. **Edit `config/application-plugins.yml`**

2. **Replace the contents with this configuration:**

```yaml
   store:
     plugins:
       enabled: true
       api-enabled: false
       metrics:
        enabled: false

       # Filter plugins run BEFORE data is saved
       filters:
         utxo.unspent.save:
           - name: "Filter UTXOs by Address"
             lang: js
             script:
               file: /app/plugins/scripts/filter-by-address.js
               function: filterByAddress

       # Event handlers react to blockchain events
       event-handlers:
         CommitEvent:
           - name: "Clean Orphaned TxInputs"
             lang: js
             script:
               file: /app/plugins/scripts/handle-commit.js
               function: handleCommitEvent
           - name: "Send Balance Change Notification"
             lang: js
             script:
               file: /app/plugins/scripts/notify-discord.js
               function: sendDiscordNotificationOnBalanceChange

         RollbackEvent:
           - name: "Handle Rollback Event"
             lang: js
             script:
               file: /app/plugins/scripts/handle-rollback.js
               function: handleRollbackEvent
```

<Callout type="info">
Note that the local `plugins` folder is mapped to `/app/plugins` for the Yaci Store docker distribution.
</Callout>

3. **Set your target address in `config/application.properties`**

   Add this line (replace with the address you want to track):

   ```properties
   # The Cardano address to track
   address.filter=addr_test1qp5z7zmlw848szvmpe693ukfu9yq4t3we4s6u483j9sq4zr09qy27awlm22wdh98zm2le5l8yluezf5amygq5d6htj5qdx4p3k
   ```

   <Callout type="info">
   This is a preprod testnet address. Replace it with any preprod address you want to track! You can get test ADA from the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/).
   </Callout>

4. **(Optional) Set up Discord webhook**

   If you want balance notifications, add this to `config/application.properties`:

   ```properties
   # Optional: Discord webhook URL for notifications
   discord.webhook.url=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
   ```

   To create a Discord webhook:
   - Go to your Discord server settings
   - Navigate to Integrations → Webhooks
   - Create a new webhook and copy the URL

---

## Step 7: Start Yaci Store

Time to launch everything!

1. **Start Yaci Store**

   ```bash
   ./yaci-store.sh start
   ```

   This will:
   - Pull the necessary Docker images (first time only)
   - Start PostgreSQL database
   - Start Yaci Store application
   - Begin synchronizing with the blockchain

2. **Watch the logs**

   ```bash
   ./yaci-store.sh logs:yaci-store
   ```
---

## Step 8: Query Your Data

Let's verify that everything is working by querying the database!

1. **Connect to the database**

   ```bash
   ./psql.sh
   ```

   This opens a PostgreSQL console connected to your Yaci Store database.

2. **Set the schema**

   ```sql
   SET search_path TO yaci_store;
   ```

3. **Check UTXOs for the monitored address**

   ```sql
   SELECT
     owner_addr,
     lovelace_amount  as lovelace,
     amounts,
     tx_hash,
     output_index,
     slot
   FROM address_utxo
   WHERE owner_addr = <monitored_address>
   ORDER BY slot DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   **What you'll see:**
   - All UTXOs currently available at your tracked address
   - The amounts in each UTXO
   - The transaction hash and output index
   - The slot number when it was created

4. **Calculate address balance**

   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(au.lovelace_amount) AS balance
   FROM address_utxo au
   WHERE au.owner_addr = <monitored_address>
   AND
   NOT EXISTS
      (SELECT 1 FROM tx_input ti
       WHERE ti.tx_hash = au.tx_hash AND ti.output_index = au.output_index);
   ```

5. **Exit the database console**

   ```sql
   \q
   ```

<Callout type="info">
If you don't see any data yet, the address might not have received any transactions since your sync starting point. Try sending some test ADA to your tracked address from the [testnet faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/)!
</Callout>

---

## Step 9: Understanding Your Setup

### What's happening behind the scenes?

1. **Yaci Store connects to the Cardano node** and requests blockchain data starting from your configured slot

2. **The node streams blocks** containing all transactions and UTXOs

3. **Your filter plugin runs** for every UTXO before it's saved:
   - If the UTXO belongs to your address → it gets saved
   - If it belongs to any other address → it's discarded

4. **The commit event handler** cleans up any transaction input records that don't match your address

5. **The notification plugin** (if configured) sends you a Discord message whenever new UTXOs arrive

### Resource usage

Because you're only tracking one address:
- **Database size:** Very small (megabytes instead of gigabytes)
- **CPU usage:** Minimal
- **Memory:** ~1-2GB for the Docker containers
- **Sync time:** Fast (only processes blocks with relevant transactions)

### Customizing for your needs

Want to track a different address? Just:
1. Stop Yaci Store: `./yaci-store.sh stop`
2. Change `address.filter` in `config/application.properties`
3. Update `store.cardano.sync-start-slot` and `store.cardano.sync-start-blockhash` in `config/application.properties` (If required)
3. Reset the database: `sudo rm -rf db-data`
4. Start again: `./yaci-store.sh start`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Plugins not loading?

Check that you:
- Uncommented the plugin loader line in `config/env`
- Set `store.plugins.enabled=true` in `config/application-plugins.yml`
- Used the correct file paths (they should start with `/app/plugins/scripts/`)

### No data appearing?

Verify:
- Your `address.filter` is set correctly
- The address has received transactions after your sync starting slot
- Yaci Store is connected to the network (check logs)

### Discord notifications not working?

- Make sure your webhook URL is correct
- Check that the address has actually received new UTXOs
- Look at the logs for any error messages

### Need to restart?

```bash
./yaci-store.sh stop
./yaci-store.sh start
```

---
