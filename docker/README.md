## 🔧 Edit Configuration

Before starting Yaci Store, you may want to update the Cardano node connection details.

Edit the following values in `config/application.properties`:

```properties
store.cardano.host=preprod-node.world.dev.cardano.org
store.cardano.port=30000
store.cardano.protocol-magic=1
```

## 🚀 Running Yaci Store

Use `yaci-store.sh` to start, stop, or view logs of the Yaci Store application.

### ✅ Start

```bash
./yaci-store.sh start
````

This starts Yaci Store and PostgreSQL in the background.

* 📍 Yaci Store API runs on **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**
* 📖 API docs (Swagger UI): **[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)**

### 🛑 Stop both Yaci Store and PostgreSQL

```bash
./yaci-store.sh stop
```

### 🛑 Stop only Yaci Store (PostgreSQL stays running)

```bash
./yaci-store.sh stop:yaci-store
```

### 📋 View logs

```bash
./yaci-store.sh logs                # Logs from all containers
./yaci-store.sh logs:yaci-store     # Only Yaci Store logs
./yaci-store.sh logs:db             # Only PostgreSQL logs
```

---

## ⚙️ Enable Ledger-State Profile

To run Yaci Store with the `ledger-state` profile:

1. Open the `env` file under the `config/` folder.
2. Uncomment or add the following line:

```env
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=ledger-state
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
./yaci-store.sh start
```

---

## 🛠️ Admin Operations

Use `admin-cli.sh` to run administrative tasks like applying indexes or rolling back to a specific epoch.

### ▶️ Apply Indexes

```bash
./admin-cli.sh apply-indexes
```

> ⚠️ This applies database indexes required for optimal read performance from API endpoints.

> 🕒 **Important:** Only run this **after the full sync is complete**. Applying indexes early can significantly slow down the sync process.

---

### 🔄 Rollback

```bash
./admin-cli.sh rollback-data --epoch <epoch_no>
```

> ⚠️ Yaci Store must be **stopped**, but PostgreSQL must remain **running** before performing rollback.
> In interactive mode, you'll be prompted to confirm.

---

## 📊 Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

Use `monitoring.sh` to start or stop the monitoring stack.

### ✅ Start monitoring services

```bash
./monitoring.sh start
```

* 📍 **Prometheus**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
* 📍 **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  Default login: `admin / changeme`

### 🛑 Stop monitoring services

```bash
./monitoring.sh stop
```

### 🔍 Accessing PostgreSQL

To connect to the PostgreSQL database running in Docker, you can use the included `psql.sh` script:

```bash
./psql.sh
```

This script opens an interactive `psql` session inside the running PostgreSQL container.

> 💡 Make sure the Yaci Store stack is already running (`./yaci-store.sh start`) before using this script.
