## Docker Compose Zip Distribution

The following files are the only ones included in the final Docker zip distributions:

- `*.yml`
- `*.sh`
- `env`

**Note:** The properties files found in this folder are ignored and are only used for local testing. The `application.properties` and `application-ledger-state.properties` files are copied from the `config` folder.
