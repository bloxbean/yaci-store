### TODO

- [ ] Find refund type in reward table
- [ ] Find out earned epoch and spendable epoch for MIR
- [ ] Find out earned epoch and spendable epoch for pool rewards
- [ ] Remove 'epoch' store dependency from staking store
- [ ] If a pool is re-registered, what happens to the previous delegations? Still valid?
- [ ] Compare yaci-store with cardano-db-sync (stake snapshots)
- [ ] Check mainnet bootstrap amount (RewardConstants.MAINNET_BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS_AMOUNT)
- [ ] Remove mainnet network specific constants from reward caculation project

## Rollback Script For Testing

To make sure stake address balance is calculated correctly, **we need to rollback to last block of an epoch.**

```sql
truncate cursor_;
insert into cursor_ (id, block_hash, slot, block_number, era) values (1000, :block_hash, :slot, :block_number, :era);
truncate account_config;
insert into account_config (config_id, status, slot, block, block_hash) values ('last_account_balance_processed_block', null, :slot, :block_number, :block_hash);
delete from adapot where slot > :slot;

## Useful Query

Utxo balance of a stake_address from address_utxo before epoch x (example: x=184)

```
SELECT sum(lovelace_amount)
FROM address_utxo a
         LEFT JOIN tx_input t
                   ON a.tx_hash = t.tx_hash
                       AND a.output_index = t.output_index
                       AND t.spent_epoch < 184
WHERE a.owner_stake_addr = 'stake_test1uzc68v00j3sdc7l03l7lf88yuqd3esjst3s5ae3txg3lgkqsey2uy' and a.epoch < 184
  AND (t.tx_hash IS NULL OR t.spent_epoch >= 184);
```
